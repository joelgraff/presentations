## I like **cake.**

+++

## I like coffee cake.
#### (with nuts)
<br><br>
## But I don't bake

+++

## My local bakery makes **really good cake**

+++

### I can buy all the cake I want,
<br>
## But I can't have the recipe.

#### (It's a trade secret)

+++

## **Software** is like **cake.**
<br><br>
@ul

### One day, I go buy a cake.
<br>
#### Before I can pay she says,
<br>
## "Sign this **contract**"

+++

<br><br>
## The terms?
<br>
### I may:
<br>
@ul
 - Eat the cake,
 - But only With my 3rd cousin.  Twice removed.
 - And I can only use my pinky finger,
 - On the third Thursday of the month.
 - **Because the baker said so.**
@ulend

### That's the part where you go
<br>
@ul
Scroll, scroll, scroll...
Click "I Agree"
@ulend
<br>
#### when you install software
+++

### And you **must** agree to
<br><br>
## any condition
<br><br>
#### (so long as it's not illegal)

+++

### If I were buying a cake,
<br>
### I'd probably look at the baker and say...

---

### Actually, I like **kale.**

## I like **cake.**

+++

## I like coffee cake.
#### (with nuts)
<br><br>
## But,
@ul
 - I don't bake
 - My local bakery makes cake
 - I can buy all the cake I want!
@ulend

+++

## But I can't have the recipe.

#### (It's a trade secret)

+++

## **Software** is like **cake.**
<br><br>
@ul
  - It's recipe is its **source code**
  - And it's a **secret**, too.
@ulend

#### One day, I go buy a cake.
<br>
#### Before I can pay she says,
<br>
## "Sign this **contract**"

+++

<br><br>
## The terms?
<br>
#### I may:
<br>
@ul
 - Eat the cake.
 - With me 3rd cousin.  Twice removed.
 - Using only my pinky finger.
 - On the third Thursday of the month.
 - Because the baker said so.
@ulend

#### In software, we call this the
## End-User License Agreement (EULA)

+++

#### That's when you install software
<br>
#### And you get to the part where you go:
<br>
@ul
 - Scroll, scroll, scroll...
 - Click "I Agree"
@ulend

+++

#### I must agree to
<br><br>
## anything condition they want
<br><br>
#### so long as it's not illegal
<br><br>

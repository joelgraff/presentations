## I like **cake.**

## I like coffee cake.
#### (with nuts)
<br>
# .  .  .
<br>
## But **I don't bake**

+++

## My local bakery makes **really good cake**

+++

## I can buy the **cake**,
<br>
## But I can't have the **recipe**
<br>
### (It's a **trade secret**)

+++

## **Software** is like **cake.**
<br><br>
@ul
<span style="font-size: 150%">
  - It's **source code** is the recipe
  - And that's a **secret**, too.

### One day, I go to the bakery
### to buy a cake.

+++

### Before I can pay for it,
### the cashier says,
<br>
## "Sign this **contract**"

+++

<br><br>
## I review the **terms**.

<br>
<span style = "font-size: 150%">
 I may only eat the cake:
 </span>
<br><br>

@ul
<span style = "font-size: 125%">
 - With my 3rd cousin.  Twice removed.
 - Using my pinky finger.
 - On the third Thursday of the month.
 - Because the baker **said so.**

#### It's also called an
## End-User License Agreement (EULA)

+++

### When you install software,
### The **EULA** is the part
### where you go,
<br><br>
<span style = "font-size: 150%">
Scroll, scroll, scroll...
<br>
and click "I Agree"
</span>

+++

### And you **must** agree to
<br><br>
## __**any condition**__
<br>
### in the EULA
<br>
**(so long as it's not illegal)**

+++

## Now,
## If I were buying a **cake**,
## that had a **EULA**,
<br><br>
### I'd probably look at the baker 
<br>
## and say...

### Actually, I like **kale.**

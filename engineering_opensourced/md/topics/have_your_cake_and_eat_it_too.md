## So what's in a **EULA**?
<br><br>
### That depends on 
### who you ask.

+++

## Some 
## **funny things** 
## end up in EULAs

+++

### **iTunes** makes it clear 
## it is **not to be used**
<br>
### to create
<br>
## weapons of mass destruction
<br><br><br><br>
[iTunes EULA, Part (G)(g)](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/us/terms.html)

+++

### and **Google** says they
<br>
### **read your email**,
### **scan your files**,
<br>
#### and can re-use
### ***anything you create***
<br>
### on their services
### for their purposes.
<br><br><br>
[Google Terms of Service, <br> "Your Content in our Services"](https://policies.google.com/terms)

+++

## don't forget **Facebook**.

+++

### Security reserachers have established
<br>
## **Facebook reads your private messages**
<br>
### to advertise to you.
<br><br><br><br>
[So Facebook allegedly reads<br>your private messages ...](https://www.zdnet.com/article/so-facebook-alledgedly-reads-your-private-messages-but-what-about-google)

## The moral of the story is simple.

+++

## If you use **prorpietary** technology
<br>
## Your data is not private.

---

### This is why
## ***Free and Open Source Software *** 
## (FOSS) 
### matters.

+++

## FOSS is freely licensed.
<br>
### That means:
<br><br>
@ul
<span style = "font-size: 125%">
- You get the source code (the recipe)
- No one can charge you to use it
- You can share it as you see fit
- You can modify it (change the recipe)
</span>
@ulend

## Best of all, FOSS is
## more **secure**,
## and
## respects your **privacy**
## and your **freedom**

+++

## In other words,
<br>
## You can have your cake
## and eat it, too.

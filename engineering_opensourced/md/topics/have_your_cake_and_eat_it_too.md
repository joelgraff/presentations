## So what's in a **EULA**?
<br><br>
### That depends on 
### who you ask.

+++

## Some **funny things** 
## end up in EULAs

+++

### **iTunes** makes it clear 
## it is **not to be used**
### to create
## weapons of mass destruction
<br><br><br>
[iTunes EULA, Part (G)(g)](https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/us/terms.html)

#### and **Google** says they
### read your email,
### scan your files,
#### and can re-use
### ***anything you create***
#### on their services
#### for their purposes.
<br><br><br>
[Google Terms of Service, <br> "Your Content in our Services"](https://policies.google.com/terms)

## And don't forget **Facebook**.
<br><br>
### Security reserachers established that
### Facebook reads your private messages
### to advertise to you.

[So Facebook allegedly reads your private messages ...](https://www.zdnet.com/article/so-facebook-alledgedly-reads-your-private-messages-but-what-about-google)

+++

## The moral of the story is simple.

+++

## If you use **prorpietary** technology
### (tech hat's controlled by a private entity),
<br>
## You have no real expectation 
## that your data remains private.
<br>
### (And you may lose control of it)

---

### This is why
## ***Free and Open Source Software *** 
### matters.

+++

## Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)
## is freely licensed.

+++

## Generally, using FOSS means:

@ul
- You get the source code (the recipe)
- No one can charge you for the software
- You can use it as you see fit
- You can modify it (change the recipe)
- You can give it away
@ulend

+++

## What's the catch?

### If you redistribute FOSS,
### you can't charge for it,
### you must enesure 
### the source code is available,
### and give credit where credit is due.

#### **Objection #1:**
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%">
"If it's free,<br>
how can it be good?"<br><br>
</span>
(you get what you pay for)

+++

<span style="font-size:150%">
Many FOSS projects<br>
are actively developed<br>
by **industry professionals**<br>
and other **domain experts**
</span>

+++

<span style="font-size:150%">
and paid support<br>
is often available<br><br>
</span>
(for larger projects)

+++
<span style="font-size:150%">
Active community support means<br><br>
</span>
<ul class=" ">
<li class="fragment li-nested-item" data-notes=" ">Software security issues are fixed quickly</li>
<li class="fragment li-nested-item" data-notes=" ">Users get support at all levels</li>
<li class="fragment li-nested-item" data-notes=" ">Development is driven by community needs</li>
</ul>

#### **Objection #2:**
<br>
<span style="font-size:150%">
"It doesn't look / act like
my favorite applications . . ."
</span>
<br><br>
(Feature-parity fallacy)

+++

<span style="font-size:150%">
Proprietary software<br>
often has<br>
**more features**<br>
than you need.<br>
</span>

+++

<span style="font-size:150%">
A FOSS project's goal<br>
is to serve community<br>
that supports it,<br>
<br>
not to beat the competition<br>
or become profitable.

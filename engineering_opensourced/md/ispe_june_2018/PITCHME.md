## I like **cake.**

+++

## I like coffee cake.
#### (with nuts)
<br>
# .  .  .
<br>
## But I don't bake

+++

## My local bakery makes **really good cake**

+++

## I can buy the **cake**,
<br>
## But I can't have the **recipe**
<br>
### (It's a **trade secret**)

+++

## **Software** is like **cake.**
<br><br>
@ul
<span style="font-size: 150%">
  - It's **source code** is the recipe
  <br>
  - And that's a **secret**, too.
</span>

### **One day, I go buy a cake.**
<br><br>
### Before I pay she says,
## "Sign this **contract**"

+++

<br><br>
## The **terms**?
<br>
### I may:
<br>
@ul
 - Eat the cake
 - But only with my 3rd cousin.  Twice removed.
 - And I can only use my pinky finger
 - On the third Thursday of the month.
 - Because the baker **said so.**

#### It's also called an
## End-User License Agreement (EULA)

+++

### **That's the part where you go,**
<br>
<span style = "font-size: 150%">
Scroll, scroll, scroll...
<br>
Click "I Agree"
</span>
<br><br><br>
### when you install
### the software

+++

### And you **must** agree to
<br><br>
## __**any condition**__
<br>
### in the EULA
<br>
**(so long as it's not illegal)**

+++

## Now,
## If I were buying a **cake**,
<br>
### I'd probably look at the baker 
<br>
## and say...

---

### Actually, I like **kale.**

#### **Objection:**

<span style="font-size:150%">
"If it's free,<br>
how can it be good?"<br><br>
</span>
(you get what you pay for)

When we speak of free,<br> 
we mean free as in **freedom**

<span style="font-size:150%">
Many FOSS projects<br>
are actively developed<br>
by **industry professionals**<br>
and other **domain experts**
</span>

<span style="font-size:150%">
Paid support<br>
is often available<br><br>
